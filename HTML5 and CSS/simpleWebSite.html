<p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth
    and current version of the HTML standard.</p>

<p>It was published in October 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)[2][3] to improve the language with support
    for the latest multimedia, while keeping it easily readable by humansâ€”and consistently understood by computers and
    devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM
    Level 2 HTML.</p>

<p> HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and
    rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs)
    for complex web applications.[5] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile
    applications, because it includes features designed with low-powered devices such as smartphones and
    tablets.HTML5</p>
