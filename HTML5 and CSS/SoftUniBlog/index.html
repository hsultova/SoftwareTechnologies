                        Standardization process[edit]
                        The Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software presented a position paper at a World Wide Web
                        Consortium (W3C) workshop in June 2004, focusing on developing technologies that are
                        backward compatible with existing browsers, including an initial draft specification of Web
                        Forms 2.0. The workshop concluded with a vote—8 for, 14 against—for continuing work on HTML.
                        Immediately after the workshop, the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)
                        was formed to start work based upon that position paper, and a second draft, Web Applications
                        1.0, was also announced. The two specifications were later merged to form HTML5. The
                        HTML5 specification was adopted as the starting point of the work of the new HTML working group
                        of the W3C in 2007.
